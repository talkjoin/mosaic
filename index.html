  <p class="letter">To my lovely wife:</p>
  <p class="letter">
    It has been quite an adventure ever since we have took that train to Montreal!
    We have been through so much together, there were ups and there were downs.
    I can't believe it has already be 10 years, and we already have two kids.
    I really enjoyed our time together: From serving together in the church Montreal,
    to exploring most of Japan and learning about its culture, to job searching in Canada,
    and then move to Hamburg and had Lauren, then moving to Paris with the moldy apartment,
    and after that finally settling in DÃ¼sseldorf and had Cyrus.
    Thank you so much for being with me every steps of the way.
    I know this year has been particular tough for you, but hang in there,
    when we look back together 10 another 10 years from now, we would talk about it for sure.
  </p>
  <p class="letter">
    I love you very much.   - Adam
